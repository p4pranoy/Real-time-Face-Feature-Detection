This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Chapter_08 (2).ipynb`) that demonstrates **image segmentation** and **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** with bounding box detection using **OpenCV** and **Pytesseract**.

## Project Overview

This notebook provides a practical example of how to:

1.  Perform basic image segmentation techniques.
2.  Utilize Pytesseract to extract text from images.
3.  Draw bounding boxes around the detected characters or words for visual verification.
4.  Display results effectively within a Jupyter (or Google Colab) environment using Matplotlib.

## Key Highlights

  * **Image Segmentation**: Basic image preprocessing steps including grayscale conversion and thresholding.
  * **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Integrates Pytesseract to perform text extraction from images.
  * **Bounding Box Visualization**: Draws rectangles around recognized text components to highlight detection results.
  * **Google Colab Compatibility**: Uses `cv2_imshow` and `matplotlib.pyplot` for seamless image display in Colab notebooks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

  * `opencv-python`
  * `numpy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `Pytesseract` (and the Tesseract OCR engine itself)

You can install the Python libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pytesseract
```

**Note**: You will also need to install the Tesseract OCR engine executable on your system. Refer to the official Pytesseract documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

### How to Run

1.  Ensure you have an image file (e.g., `image.jpg` as suggested by the notebook content) in the same directory as the notebook. This image should contain text for OCR.

2.  Open the notebook using Jupyter:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Chapter_08 (2).ipynb"
    ```

3.  Execute the cells sequentially to see the image segmentation and OCR in action.
